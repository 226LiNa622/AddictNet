AddictNet: A Machine Learning Approach for Risk Modeling and Pathways Integrating Biopsychosocial Factors for Drug Misuse in Adolescents and Young Adults


This ML predictive model, designed to address data imbalance, identifies critical biopsychosocial risk factors and enables early intervention for drug misuse in adolescents and young adults. We also employed Bayesian network to elucidate the underlying mechanistic pathways, integrating biopsychosocial factors to comprehensively understand the complex relationships among variables and their collective impact on outcomes.
